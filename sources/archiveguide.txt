This embed will tell you how to set up a story in my archive.

To start, use the `lap.addstory` command to add a new story, and give it your story's name in quotes.
```lap.addstory "Null Protocol"```

Next, you may use the `lap.addgenre` command to give your story a genre - these can be found using the command `lap.listgenres`. You can use this multiple times to add multiple genres to your story. Since these are all single-word, no quotes are necessary.
```lap.addgenre Adventure
lap.addgenre Friendship```

To add a rating to your story, use the `lap.setrating` command. Possible ratings can be found using the command `lap.listratings`.
```lap.setrating T```

If you want, you may add a reason why you rated your story the way you did with the `lap.setratingreason` command. This can be anything and can include spoilers if you wish. Note that the reason must be surrounded in quotes.
```lap.setratingreason "Swearing, ||graphic depictions of violence||"```

Multiple characters can be added to your story through the `lap.addcharacter` command. Give it a species followed by a name (if applicable / wanted). If a species or name has spaces in it, you will need to surround it in quotes, otherwise this is not necessary.
```lap.addcharacter Cyndaquil Quil
lap.addcharacter Mienfoo Orial
lap.addcharacter Yveltal "The Living God"```

Next you can add a summary to your story with the `lap.setsummary` command. Note that the summary must be surrounded in quotes.
```lap.setsummary "Forterra has been swept by the new pandemic mystery dungeons... etc."```

Last in the list is the links, which can be added using the `lap.addlink` command. It takes a name for the link and the link itself. The list of valid link names can be found using the `lap.listlinknames` command.
```lap.addlink AO3 https://archiveofourown.org/```
